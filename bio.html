      <h5>Biography</h5>

    <div class="col-sm-8">
      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>I was originally born in New Jersey. However, when I was about 4 years old, my family moved to Luray, Virginia where I was raised for the rest of my life. While growing up, I had a difficult time learning English as a second language, 
	  considering that Gujarati (Indo-Aryan language) was my native language. By the time I was a junior in high school my family had to move to Winchester, Virginia. It was here where I received my Advanced Diploma from Millbrook High School.</p>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>My short term goals are to acquire an internship as a Software Developer near Winchester, VA. I believe my skills are sufficient enough to take on the roles and challenges that come with this position.   In the future, I hope to work near 
	  the DC area where I could further my skills at a company that would engage in my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.</p>
	  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>During my down-time, I especially enjoy playing basketball with my close friends. When it comes to indoor activities, I like listening to music and watching movies. As of right now, my favorite movie is Avengers Endgame. I also enjoy watching 
	  tv shows such as Rick and Morty and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.</p>
